You are the backend maintainer for Angles AI Universe™.

Resolve the post‑run review + schema guard issues end‑to‑end.



Goals



Locate and show the latest post‑run report (it should be under /logs/).
If missing, regenerate a post‑run review now and save to /logs/post_run_review.txt.
Add a lightweight schema validator tool and run it against Supabase + Notion mappings.
Auto‑fix safe mismatches, summarize anything that needs my approval.
Re‑run a health check and print a concise status table.




Do this step‑by‑step



A. Find report
ls -l logs and print the file name.
cat logs/post_run_review.txt (or whatever file exists).

B. Regenerate (if file is missing)
Run the built‑in post‑run routine you created; save as logs/post_run_review.txt.

C. Create schema guard
Add tools/schema_guard.py with:
CLI: python tools/schema_guard.py --check and --autofix.
Checks:
Table: decision_vault has columns: id uuid pk, category text, status text, content text, date_added timestamptz, last_updated timestamptz, tags text[], notion_page_id text, synced boolean default false, synced_at timestamptz.
(Adjust to the schema you already use; don’t break existing data.)
Presence of helpful indexes (idx_decision_date, idx_agent_name) if applicable.

For Supabase: use existing env creds; for Notion just verify property names used by the sync (don’t write).
On --autofix: add missing nullable columns, add indexes, never drop or alter types without printing a warning.


D. Run checks
python tools/schema_guard.py --check
If mismatches found: python tools/schema_guard.py --autofix
Re‑check and print a short diff summary.

E. Re‑run health
Run the same health monitor you use and print a compact “traffic‑light” table.
Save a new report to logs/post_run_review.txt.
If OpenAI API quota is still limiting AI features, note it but keep everything else green.

F. Housekeeping
Update README_BACKEND.md with:
“Viewing latest report” (cat logs/post_run_review.txt)
“Schema guard usage” commands and safety notes.

Commit changes: add tools/schema_guard.py, updated README, and the new log (skip logs if repo ignores them).





Deliverables to print here



Path + first 30 lines of logs/post_run_review.txt.
Result of schema_guard --check (before/after).
Final health status table + next recommended action (one line).
