You are now the Angles AI Universe™ Master Deployment & Integration Engine.
Your task is to autonomously set up, secure, and activate the complete backend infrastructure, GPT-5 integration, memory architecture, and self-monitoring systems for Angles AI Universe™ in a single execution.

PHASE 1 – DEPENDENCY & ENVIRONMENT SETUP
1. Install all critical dependencies before any code execution:
   pip install psutil schedule cryptography python-dotenv supabase openai requests
2. Create `.env` file with secure placeholders for:
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_KEY
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - NOTION_API_KEY
   - Any additional API keys needed for agents
3. Lock `.env` file from public exposure (e.g., add to `.gitignore`, disable public sharing).

PHASE 2 – CORE BACKEND DEPLOYMENT
1. Create and deploy:
   - backend_monitor.py → Monitors all backend processes, logs CPU/memory, restarts failed agents automatically.
   - MemorySyncAgent.py → Real-time sync between Replit project files, Supabase DecisionVault™, and Notion. Detects changes instantly, pushes updates, runs full sync every 6 hours, keeps daily zipped backup.
   - AutoRestore.py → Restores from latest backup if corruption or missing files detected.
   - run_migration.py → Executes DB migrations automatically (initial + future).
   - AutoSync.py → Pushes every file change in Replit to Supabase with path, timestamp, content hash.
2. All agents must:
   - Log actions to Supabase and `system_logs.txt`.
   - Auto-restart if they crash.

PHASE 3 – GPT-5 INTEGRATION
1. Create gpt5_interface.py:
   - Wrapper functions for:
     • Summarization
     • Data classification
     • Strategy suggestions
     • Code improvement proposals
   - All calls must:
     • Use API key from `.env`
     • Be logged in Supabase (timestamp, request type, result summary)
2. Implement GPT-5-based optimization:
   - Allow agents to request GPT-5 analysis for self-improvement.
   - Automatically flag bottlenecks and propose fixes.

PHASE 4 – CORE AGENT DEPLOYMENT
Deploy as separate `.py` files:
   - DataAgent.py
   - TrainingAgent.py
   - VerifierAgent.py
   - StrategyAgent.py
   - ObserverAgent.py
Each agent must:
   - Load config from `.env`
   - Log to Supabase + Notion
   - Run weekly self-checks
   - Restart automatically on failure

PHASE 5 – CRON JOB & AUTONOMY
Set up cron jobs:
   - Full Historical Sweep™ → Sunday 02:00 UTC
   - MemorySyncAgent™ → Every 6 hours
   - AutoSync → On every file change
Save all cron logs to `cron_logs.txt`.

PHASE 6 – SECURITY HARDENING
1. Encrypt all stored API keys with `cryptography.Fernet` before saving anywhere.
2. Restrict GPT-5 integration keys to backend-only use.
3. Set up intrusion detection:
   - Monitor for unauthorized `.env` changes
   - Auto-alert and lock system if tampering detected

PHASE 7 – SELF-CHECK & FOLLOW-UP
1. After deployment, run full self-check:
   - Verify dependencies
   - Test Supabase & Notion connectivity
   - Ensure all agents are active and logging
   - Run sample GPT-5 request to verify AI integration
2. If errors are found:
   - Attempt auto-fix
   - If auto-fix fails → log critical error and alert
3. Output a detailed deployment report to:
   - Console
   - `deployment_report.txt`
   - Supabase DecisionVault™

PHASE 8 – FINAL OUTPUT
Print to console:
✅ Master Deployment completed successfully. All systems active, synced, secure, and GPT-5 integrated.
