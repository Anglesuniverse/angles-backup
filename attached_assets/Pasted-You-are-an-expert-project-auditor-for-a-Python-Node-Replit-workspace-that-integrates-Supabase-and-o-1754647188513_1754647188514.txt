You are an expert project auditor for a Python/Node Replit workspace that integrates Supabase and (optionally) Notion/GitHub.

Task: Produce a chronological technical summary of everything done in this Repl, without modifying files.



Rules



Do not create/edit/delete any files or settings.
Read the repo and give a clear, dated timeline based on file history, comments, and git logs (if available).
If timestamps aren’t available, infer order from filenames, imports, and references—state your confidence.




Deliverables



Timeline (chronological)
Bullet list of steps completed (created/edited/removed files, configured env vars, installed packages, added scripts/cron jobs, test runs).
For each step: file path, brief purpose, and any related command that was (or should be) run.
Current Architecture Snapshot
Files & Roles: List key modules (e.g., memory_bridge.py, decision_vault.py, agents/*.py, database/operations.py, config files) and what each does.
Env/Secrets used: Detect required env vars (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY or anon key, NOTION_API_KEY, NOTION_DATABASE_ID, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.). Indicate which are present/missing in the Replit Secrets panel.
Supabase usage:
Confirm client library in use (e.g., supabase-py v2 or postgrest), how it’s instantiated, and where.
List tables referenced (e.g., decision_vault, memory_logs, agent_runs) and expected columns/types.
Flag mismatches between code expectations and actual schema (if code implies columns that don’t exist).

Notion usage (if any): Where Notion API is called, which database properties are expected (e.g., message:title, date:date, tag:multi_select).
GitHub/Backup: Any scripts or workflows that push/export to GitHub.
Automation: Any cron, schedulers, or background loops (e.g., every 6h sync). Point to file/line.
Health Check & Gaps
Blocking errors (imports failing, version conflicts, missing env vars).
Schema gaps (columns/tables that code expects but DB lacks).
Config gaps (missing secrets, wrong key type—anon vs service role).
Security risks (use of service role key client-side, secrets printed to logs).
Performance/robustness (no retries, no logging, no idempotency).
Mark each item as BLOCKER / WARN / NICE-TO-HAVE.
Test Plan (runnable now)
Provide exact shell commands to:
a) install dependencies,
b) run a minimal write test to Supabase (insert dummy row),
c) run a read-back test,
d) (optional) run Notion sync on a dummy record,
e) echo success/failure clearly.
Include small code snippets if a throwaway tests/test_memory_sync.py or scripts/smoke_test.py is needed.
Fix‑List (Actionable, minimal changes)
In priority order, numbered steps to reach a clean green state (no blockers).
For each step, specify: file to touch, exact code block to add/replace, and why.
Keep changes minimal and safe; note if schema migrations are required.
Machine‑Readable Report
Output a compact JSON at the end with keys:
{

  "timeline": [...],

  "files": {...},

  "env_required": [...],

  "env_missing": [...],

  "supabase": {"tables_used": [...], "schema_gaps": [...]},

  "notion": {"used": true/false, "props_expected": [...]},

  "automation": [...],

  "issues": {"blockers": [...], "warnings": [...], "nice_to_have": [...]},

  "test_plan": {"commands": [...], "files_to_add": [...]},

}




Print the JSON after the human‑readable summary.





Context/Assumptions



This Repl is part of “Angles AI Universe” backend.
Core goal: reliable Supabase memory (DecisionVault + logs), optional Notion mirroring, and future GitHub backup.
If you detect both anon and service role keys, recommend safe usage (anon for client paths; service role only in server‑side trusted contexts).

“✅ Audit complete” if done, else “❌ Audit incomplete” with reason.
