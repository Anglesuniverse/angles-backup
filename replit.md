# GPT Assistant Output Processor

## Overview

This is a sophisticated data processing system designed to automatically handle GPT assistant outputs and manage them in both Supabase and Notion databases. The application intelligently processes various types of GPT-generated content, with a specialized focus on architect decisions management. The system features unified sync operations that store decisions in both Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Notion simultaneously, providing redundancy and cross-platform accessibility.

## System Architecture

### Processing Pipeline Architecture
The system follows a multi-stage pipeline pattern for processing GPT outputs:
- **Parsing Stage**: Handles JSON, structured text, and unstructured content using the GPTParser
- **Classification Stage**: Uses keyword matching, structure analysis, and pattern recognition to determine appropriate data routing
- **Validation Stage**: Employs Pydantic schemas to ensure data integrity before storage
- **Storage Stage**: Manages database operations with retry logic and error handling

### Database Layer Design
The architecture implements a three-tier database abstraction:
- **SupabaseClient**: Low-level connection management and basic CRUD operations
- **DatabaseOperations**: High-level, domain-specific operations (conversations, memories, tasks)
- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic-based validation ensuring data consistency

### Memory Management System
The application uses an intelligent classification system that:
- Analyzes content using weighted scoring algorithms
- Routes data to appropriate tables (conversations, memories, tasks) based on keyword matching and structural patterns
- Maintains processing statistics and performance metrics
- Supports configurable retention policies for long-term memory management

### Error Handling and Resilience
The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to unstructured parsing when structured parsing fails
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks processing metrics and operation timings
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with rotating file handlers

### Configuration Management
Centralized configuration system supporting:
- Environment variable-based configuration with sensible defaults
- Configurable processing intervals, batch sizes, and retry policies
- Flexible table schema definitions via JSON configuration
- Performance tuning parameters for concurrent operations

## External Dependencies

### Database Services
- **Supabase**: Primary database service using PostgreSQL backend with `architect_decisions` table
- **Supabase Python Client**: Official client library for database operations
- **Notion API**: Secondary storage and collaboration platform for architect decisions
- **Notion Client**: Official Python client for Notion API integration

### Data Processing Libraries
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment variable management for configuration

### Utility Libraries
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous I/O operations for concurrent processing
- **pathlib**: Modern path handling for file system operations
- **json**: Native JSON parsing and serialization
- **re**: Regular expression processing for content analysis
- **logging**: Native Python logging with rotating file handlers

### Development Dependencies
- **typing**: Type hints for better code maintainability and IDE support

The system is designed to be easily extensible, with clear separation of concerns and modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new data types, classification algorithms, or storage backends.

## Disaster Recovery

### Overview
The system includes comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities through automated GitHub backups and intelligent restore operations. All memory data is safely backed up to GitHub with full validation and conflict resolution.

### Backup System
- **Automated Backups**: Daily automated backups to GitHub repository
- **Sanitized Exports**: All secrets and sensitive data automatically removed
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart Git conflict handling with safe force-push capabilities
- **Multi-source**: Backs up from both Supabase and Notion databases
- **Rotating History**: Maintains 30 days of backup history with automatic cleanup

### Restore Operations

#### Quick Restore Commands

**1. Dry Run (Always run first):**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py --dry-run
```
Shows exactly what would be restored without making any changes.

**2. Restore Latest Backup:**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py
```
Restores from the most recent backup files automatically.

**3. Restore Specific Date:**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py --at 2025-08-07
```
Restores backups from a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD format).

**4. Restore with Notion Sync:**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py --with-notion
```
Restores to both Supabase and recreates Notion pages.

**5. Force Restore (Dangerous):**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py --file exports/backup.json --force
```
Overwrites newer records (use only when certain).

#### Advanced Restore Examples

**Restore specific backup file:**
```bash
python run_restore_now.py --file exports/decision_vault_2025-08-07.json
```

**Complete disaster recovery:**
```bash
# Step 1: Always dry-run first
python run_restore_now.py --at 2025-08-07 --dry-run

# Step 2: If dry-run looks good, run live restore
python run_restore_now.py --at 2025-08-07 --with-notion
```

### Safety Features
- **Dry Run Mode**: Always test restores before executing
- **Timestamp Comparison**: Automatically skips restoring older data over newer data
- **Schema Validation**: Validates all data before restoration
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents duplicate entries during restore
- **Progress Logging**: Detailed logs in `logs/restore.log`
- **Rollback Support**: Can restore to any previous backup point

### Verification System
Nightly automated verification runs dry-run restores to ensure:
- Backup files are valid and accessible
- Git repository is properly synchronized
- Restore system is functioning correctly
- All environment variables are properly configured

### Emergency Recovery Procedure

**If system is completely lost:**

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `REPO_URL`
   - `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` (optional)

2. **Clone/pull latest backups:**
   ```bash
   git clone $REPO_URL .
   # or
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Run dry-run verification:**
   ```bash
   python run_restore_now.py --dry-run
   ```

4. **Execute restore:**
   ```bash
   python run_restore_now.py --with-notion
   ```

5. **Verify restoration:**
   - Check Supabase `decision_vault` table
   - Check Notion database pages
   - Run memory sync to verify connectivity

### Backup File Structure
- `export/decision_vault_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Supabase exports
- `export/notion_decisions_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Notion exports  
- `export/decisions_YYYYMMDD.json` - Combined exports
- `logs/` - System operation logs (excluded from public repos)

### Troubleshooting

**Restore fails with "No snapshot files found":**
- Ensure Git repository is up to date: `git pull origin main`
- Check export/ directory exists and contains backup files
- Use `--file` option to specify explicit backup file

**Git conflicts during backup:**
- System automatically resolves most conflicts
- Check logs for conflict resolution details
- Manual resolution rarely needed due to smart conflict handling

**Notion restore fails:**
- Verify `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` are set
- Check Notion integration has proper database permissions
- Use `--dry-run` to test Notion connectivity without writes

**Supabase restore fails:**
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` are correct
- Ensure `decision_vault` table exists with proper schema
- Check network connectivity to Supabase

All restore operations are logged to `logs/restore.log` for detailed troubleshooting.
